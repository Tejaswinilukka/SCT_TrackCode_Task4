# Hand Gesture --> project Title

# Tools and Libraries Used

1. Python – Programming Language
2. OpenCV – Hand tracking and image preprocessing
3. NumPy & Pandas – Data manipulation and handling
4. Matplotlib – Data/image visualization
5. Scikit-learn – Model training and evaluation
6. (Optional) TensorFlow / Keras – For deep learning (e.g., CNN models)
7. (Optional) MediaPipe – For hand landmarks detection (Google's solution)


This project is part of the SkillCraft Technology Machine Learning series (Task-04). It focuses on recognizing and classifying hand gestures using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The model is trained on hand gesture data to detect specific signs or movements in real-time.
